# Map-JS
## Intro
In telecommunication buisiness, Voice Traffic is logged with a raw switch data called CDR. The totall data availale from all of the operators all over the country is huge (around 2 billion call records per day). Also there is a growning need for operators and adminstrative authorities to monitor the current network status for BA purposes.
## What is Map-JS?
As a system engineer in [Mohaymen ICT](https://www.mohaymen.ir/en/) I designed a monitoring system for a near-live voice traffic web-based dashboard using PHP, Javascript and Python. Using Python queris are sent to oracle database and Voice traffic vs lat & long is fetched. then using a front Javascript code and [heatmap.js](https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs), traffic is illustrated in a country map.
## Important Note
The actual data which is provided from Mohaymen database is not available in this repository due to security issues. But the data format is depicted in the following picture
